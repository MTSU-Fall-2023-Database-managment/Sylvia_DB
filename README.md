Stock Analytics Database

Effective analysis and evaluation of stock data is a key component went it comes to investing, and evaluation of historic data can help forecast upcoming stock performance and pricing. In the creation of a stock analysis application we intend to parse, organize, and analyze stock data. The goal is to pull raw stock data periodically from a reputable data source to store in a local database to be formatted for multiple possible usages. This formatted data can be further used to perform in-depth analysis that can be graphed and outlined.
